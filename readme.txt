Very Simple light weight social plugin to integrate single click facebook like and google+ button on every post and configurable popup box.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to add a facebook like button and google+ button to each of your post, just before the post contents.
They are styled float on left part. Thus shown closely with the contents, which it the conversion rate a lot higher. Moreover, as they
being one click action button, users tends to use them more then the share buttons. This have a simple administration which facilitates
to disable/enable the buttons as per your own will. 

This also includes a facebook popup box feature, which will show up to user after a certain delay(configurable via settings). This is
great over other plugins as this doesn't show up immediately that annoys visitor, rather than after a delay so that they can get the time
to read your post and thus have a higher conversion rate of getting more facebook fans. Also, instead of showing on every page load, this
popup box is shown once every 7 days, managed by browser cookies.

I have this plugin implemented on my <a href="http://codesamplez.com" target="_blank">Programming Tutorials</a> blog, which you can checkout as demo.

I am looking forward if you want some more customization feature on it. Just let me know.Thanks.

1. Upload `like-fb` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go To your wordpress administration area and use "Settings"->"Like FB" menu option to customize the settings.
4. Good Luck :)
