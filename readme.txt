Very Simple light weight plugin to integrate facebook like and google+ button on every post

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to add a facebook like button and google+ button to each of your post, just before the post contents.
They are styled float on left part. Thus shown closely with the contents, which it the conversion rate a lot higher. Moreove, as they
being one click action button, users tends to use them more then the share buttons. This have a simple administration which facilitates
to disable/enable the buttons as per your own will. I am looking forward if you want some more customization feature on it. Just let me
know.Thanks.
