<h1>PHP HTML5 Video Streaming Demo:</h1>
<p>
    This demo is built on the tutorial for video streaming with PHP. The file link below doesn't exist on the same physical location.
    It is read and sent to browser via PHP. By chaning the mime types, you should be able to stream audio media as well. The tutorial
    also shows example on streaming media directly from AWS S3 as well.
</p>
<div class="alert-info">This Demo may not be played on Firefox browser as firefox doesn't have mp4 format support natively. But should work fine on chrome
and safari.</div>
