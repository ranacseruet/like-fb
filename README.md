Very Simple light weight plugin to integrate facebook like and google+ button on every post and facebook popup likebox 

Description
===========
This plugin will allow you to add a facebook like button and google+ button to each of your post, just before the post contents.
They are styled float on left part. Thus shown closely with the contents, which it the conversion rate a lot higher. Moreove, as they
being one click action button, users tends to use them more then the share buttons. This have a simple administration which facilitates
to disable/enable the buttons as per your own will. 

Another feature is facebook popup box. When user load your website it will show your facebook page with popup box. You can set the
popup delay time(by default it is 2sec) from administration area. You should check the show popup box field and give your facebook page on 
settings area.

I am looking forward if you want some more customization feature on it. Just let me
know.Thanks.
